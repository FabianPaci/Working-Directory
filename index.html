        <h1>Working Directory / Repository / Documentation / whatever you wanna call it</h1>
        <p>basically just curated study notes</p>
        <p>Its minimalistic design is intended to be fast, lightweight, and portable. I recommend using a dark mode extension of some kind to not make your eyes burn.</p>
        <p>I also recommend the Feynman technique as a means to study.</p>
        <p>use ctrl+f (by default on your keyboard) to search.</p>
